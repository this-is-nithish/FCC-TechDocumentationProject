                                Modern life could not exist if it were not for electricity and electronics. The history of electricity starts more than two thousand years ago, with the Greek philosopher Thales being the earliest known researcher into electricity. But it was Alessandro Volta who created the most common DC power source, the battery (for this invention the unit Volt was named after him).

                                Direct current (also known as DC) is the flow of charged particles in one unchanging direction (most commonly found as electron flow through conductive materials). DC can be found in just about every home and electronic device, as it is more practical (compared to AC from power stations) for many consumer devices. Just a few of the places where you can find direct current are batteries, phones, computers, cars, TVs, calculators, and even lightning.

                                It was discovered centuries ago that certain types of materials would mysteriously attract one another after being rubbed together. For example, after rubbing a piece of silk against a piece of glass, the silk and glass would tend to stick together. Indeed, there was an attractive force that could be demonstrated even when the two materials were separated:
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                Glass and silk aren’t the only materials known to behave like this. Anyone who has ever brushed up against a latex balloon only to find that it tries to stick to them has experienced this same phenomenon. Paraffin wax and wool cloth are another pair of materials early experimenters recognized as manifesting attractive forces after being rubbed together:

                        </header><br>
                        <p>
                                The first, and perhaps most important, the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is called Ohm’s Law, discovered by Georg Simon Ohm and published in his 1827 paper, The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                An electric circuit is formed when a conductive path is created to allow electric charge to continuously move. This continuous movement of electric charge through the conductors of a circuit is called a current, and it is often referred to in terms of “flow,” just like the flow of a liquid through a hollow pipe.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                The force motivating charge carriers to “flow” in a circuit is called voltage. Voltage is a specific measure of potential energy that is always relative between two points.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                When we speak of a certain amount of voltage being present in a circuit, we are referring to the measurement of how much potential energy exists to move charge carriers from one particular point in that circuit to another particular point. Without reference to two particular points, the term “voltage” has no meaning.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                Current tends to move through the conductors with some degree of friction, or opposition to motion. This opposition to motion is more properly called resistance. The amount of current in a circuit depends on the amount of voltage and the amount of resistance in the circuit to oppose current flow.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                Just like voltage, resistance is a quantity relative between two points. For this reason, the quantities of voltage and resistance are often stated as being “between” or “across” two points in a circuit.

                                With this lesson, I hope to avoid a common mistake found in electronics textbooks of either ignoring or not covering with sufficient detail the subject of electrical safety. I assume that whoever reads this book has at least a passing interest in actually working with electricity, and as such the topic of safety is of paramount importance. Those authors, editors, and publishers who fail to incorporate this subject into their introductory texts are depriving the reader of life-saving information.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                As an instructor of industrial electronics, I spend a full week with my students reviewing the theoretical and practical aspects of safe work practices. The same textbooks I found lacking in technical clarity, I also found lacking in coverage of electrical safety. Hence, the creation of this chapter. Its placement after the first two chapters is intentional: in order for the concepts of electrical safety to make the most sense, some foundational knowledge of electricity is necessary.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                Another benefit of including a detailed lesson on electrical safety is the practical context it sets for basic concepts of voltage, current, resistance, and circuit design. The more relevant a technical topic can be made, the more likely a student will be to pay attention and comprehend. And what could be more relevant than application to your own personal safety? Also, with electrical power being such an everyday presence in modern life, almost anyone can relate to the illustrations given in such a lesson. Have you ever wondered why birds don’t get shocked while resting on power lines? Read on and find out!

                                In many disciplines of science and engineering, very large and very small numerical quantities must be managed. Some of these quantities are mind-boggling in their size, either extremely small or extremely large. Take for example the mass of a proton, one of the constituent particles of an atom’s nucleus:<br>

                                Proton mass = 0.00000000000000000000000167 grams
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                Or, consider the number of electrons passing by a point in a circuit every second with a steady electric current of 1 amp:<br>

                                1 amp = 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons per second
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                A lot of zeros, isn’t it? Obviously, it can get quite confusing to have to handle so many zero digits in numbers such as this, even with the help of calculators and computers.
                        </p><br>

                        <p>
                                Take note of those two numbers and of the relative sparsity of non-zero digits in them. For the mass of the proton, all we have is a “167” preceded by 23 zeros before the decimal point. For the number of electrons per second in 1 amp, we have “625” followed by 16 zeros.<br>

                                We call the span of non-zero digits (from first to last), plus any zero digits not merely used as placeholders, the “significant digits” of any number.<br><br>

                                The significant digits in a real-world measurement are typically reflective of the accuracy of that measurement. For example, if we were to say that a car weighs 3,000 pounds, we probably don’t mean that the car in question weighs exactly 3,000 pounds, but that we’ve rounded its weight to a value more convenient to say and remember.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                                That rounded figure of 3,000 has only one significant digit: the “3” in front—the zeros merely serve as placeholders. However, if we were to say that the car weighed 3,005 pounds, the fact that the weight is not rounded to the nearest thousand pounds tells us that the two zeros in the middle aren’t just placeholders, but that all four digits of the number “3,005” are significant to its representative accuracy. Thus, the number “3,005” is said to have four significant figures.<br>

                                In like manner, numbers with many zero digits are not necessarily representative of a real-world quantity all the way to the decimal point. When this is known to be the case, such a number can be written in a kind of mathematical “shorthand” to make it easier to deal with. This “shorthand” is called scientific notation.<br><br>

                                With scientific notation, a number is written by representing its significant digits as a quantity between 1 and 10 (or -1 and -10, for negative numbers), and the “placeholder” zeros are accounted for by a power-of-ten multiplier. For example:<br><br>

                                1 amp = 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons per second<br><br>

                                . . . can be expressed as . . .<br><br>

                                1 amp = 6.25 x 1018 electrons per second
                        </p>

                        <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.
